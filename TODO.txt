# TODO

- improve finding/prompting releases
  - specify group by --{releases,masters,artists,albums}
  - add '--prompt' flag to prompt for single/multiple
  - rename 'find_releases' to just #find or #search?
  - improve searching
    - use same logic between CLI arguments & prompt input
    - sort results by relevance, not by artist/title
    - allow multiples in prompt
      - by series
      - by built-up selection

- improve cover art
  - extract cover images from ripped tracks when importing
      chdir(tmpdir) do
        FILE = album.tracks.first.file
        mp4art --extract --art-index=0 FILE
        # cover is in FILE[0].jpg
      end
      FILE.rename(cover_file)
  - move cover-maker into separate class
  - get images when doing 'update'
  - retire 'get-cover' command
  - store all images in top-level images/ directory
    - link image files to releases/masters in @image_files
        @image_files = {
          primary: [files...],
          secondary: [files...],
          ...,
        }
  - check for orphaned images
  - select cover/back image  - symlink cover/back -> selected image file
  - find albums that are missing cover art
  - show cover art in terminal
    - when playing, searching
        convert ./albums/13714693/cover.jpg -resize 800x800 TIFF:- | imgcat

- auto-play in player on start

- split up 'dir' command into 'open' & 'dir'

- make MusicBox a class that can be instantiated?
  - then can have multiple parts
    - Catalog, Updater, Player, Importer, Exporter, Extractor
  - move config handling into main class
    - also definition of import/extract dir
  - move commands (called from CLI)

- allow searching by track titles

- improve 'select' tool
  - save to $MUSIC_ROOT/selection.json?
  - optionally name
  - can be referred to in query

- improve discogs update
  - don't simply delete previous collection
  - determine additions/removals/changes
  - handle case where Discogs has merged/moved releases
    - ie, release_id has changed
    - need to move related album

- when finding unripped CDs, also look for dups
  - to avoid needing to rip dup CDs

- fix Player playlist display
  - tends not to show in 'r'/'t' mode
  - use curses or tty for full-screen TTY mode

- allow artist key to be user-defined
  - save in group database
  - allow for modification as needed
  - ensure uniqueness
  - allow override of primary artist
    - eg, to file release under main artist instead of artist-group of collaboration
  - do artist sort/rename using artist ID
    - instead of CanonicalArtists/PersonalNames hash maps

- use exiftool instead of ffprobe/mp4tags
  $ exiftool -json -recurse . -ext m4a

- handle importing logs like tracks
  - create Log class with attributes:
    - timestamp
    - media type
    - accurip details
    - file:
    - disc: (can be nil)
    - status: (overall)
    - tracks status: (tracks)
  - add command to show:
    - missing rips (no tracks or log files)
    - questionable rips (tracks, but no log files)
    - unconfirmed rips (no record in online databases)
    - bad rips (actual read errors)
    - dubious rips (inconsistent checksums)
    - successful rips

- improve validation
  - rename 'validate' to 'check'?
  - ensure track files exist, and correspond to release

- calculate loudness
