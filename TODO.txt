# TODO

- fix 'show-artists' command

- make 'update-tags' work again?

- create Artist data
  + allow artist key to be user-defined
  - when importing/updating, prompt for artist
    - new
    - personal name
  - save in group database
  - allow for modification as needed
  - allow override of primary artist
    - eg, to file release under main artist instead of artist-group of collaboration
  - do artist sort/rename using artist ID
    - instead of CanonicalArtists/PersonalNames hash maps
  - ensure artist key is unique
    - doesn't represent multiple artists

- add play history
  - choose random tracks/albums that haven't been played recently
  - or that *have* been played recently (new releases)

- when importing, rename possible 'cover.{jpg,png}' to 'original-cover...'

- don't save actual filename in Track
  - save type/ext (m4a) as separate field
  - construct filename from disc/track/title/type
  - write fixup to rename current files to re-constructed names
    - backup catalog first!

- see if taglib-ruby will substitute for ffprobe/mp4tags/mp4art/etc.

- re-implement file-based Group
  - convert all Discogs structures

- reimplement 'select' command
  - save permanently
  - with optional name
  - can be referred to in query

- research MusicBrainz
  - get MBIDs from logs?
  - store MBIDs in track/album files
    https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier

- when selecting cover, show cover images & info in iTerm
  - instead of shelling out to Preview
  - show resolution, file size, file name

- experiment with volume up/down keys
  - in exclusive mode
  - does it work with Musicstreamer?

- describe player modes in README
  - 3-function player: play random album, play random tracks (typical shuffle mode), or play the album for the current track

- integrate/expand ripping HOWTO

- consider using `cover_image` from collection item instead of `images` from release

- improve covers:
  - make 2-up
  - center horizontally on page
  - make crop marks

- import: handle multiple formats/discs better
  - consider case where digitized LP or downloaded tracks becomes album
  - if more than one format, prompt for choice
  - but how to handle multidisc releases 
    - some have formats of [CD, CD] ('expanded')
    - others have [CD x2] ('compact')
  - save selected format into album info
  - in general:
    - use Discogs data as a guide/template
      - but allow assigning, collapsing, expanding, reordering as needed

- allow creation of standalone album
  - for: unreleased, mixtape, etc.

- allow label font to be configured

- when importing/updating, save track info to JSON file
  - bit depth
  - sample rate
  - channels
  - format/codec

- have player read default settings from config
  - audio-device, exclusive, EQ, etc.
  - either global (single), or as profiles (multiple)
    - so can have one for headphones, and another for speakers
    - add --profile=X flag to specify profile
    - or specify multiple configs?

- use curses or tty for full-screen player TTY mode?

- sort #find results by relevance, not by artist/title

- when updating collection, don't simply delete previous collection
  - determine additions/removals/changes
  - handle case where Discogs has merged/moved releases
    - ie, release_id has changed
    - need to move related album

- improve log handling
  - create Log class with attributes:
    - timestamp
    - media type
    - accurip details
    - file:
    - disc: (can be nil)
    - status: (overall)
    - tracks status: (tracks)
  - add command to show:
    - missing rips (no tracks or log files)
    - questionable rips (tracks, but no log files)
    - unconfirmed rips (no record in online databases)
    - bad rips (actual read errors)
    - dubious rips (inconsistent checksums)
    - successful rips

- calculate loudness
